# Welcome

Hello there. I'm 0xFF00FF aka SirOcram on various platforms and i'm interested in penetrationtesting and writing down my thoughts for others or for me to recap myself what i just have learned.

I have started with Try Hack Me and at this moment i'm in the top 3% :tada:

So i decided to switch the platform to Hack The Box and start the "Penetration Tester" path.

I also did some courses from The Cyber Mentor like the following:

* Practical Bug Bounty
* Practical API Hacking
* Beginner's Guide to IoT and Hardware Hacking
* Practical Ethical Hacking
* Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners
* Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners

I had my first "1st Annual TCM Invitational CTF" from MetaCTF ([https://metactf.com/](https://metactf.com/)) with 3 international team mates and we gained place #38 of 166 teams.

In this book i will write down my paths through the boxes how i solved them. On the other hand i write some technical and non-technical reports from the solved boxes - as pentesters do.
