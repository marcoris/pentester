# Welcome

Hello there. I'm 0xFF00FF aka SirOcram and i completed my bachelor's degree in computer science with majority in cybersecurity in august 2023. You find me on various CTF/Bug Bounty platforms and i'm interested in penetrationtesting and writing down my thoughts for others or for me to recap myself what i just have learned.

I have started with Try Hack Me and at this moment i'm in the top 3% :tada:

Here are some "certificates" of the learning paths:

* Pre Security ([Download](.gitbook/assets/THM-9WG8AZRCOQ\_pre\_security\_learning\_path.png))
* Introduction to Cyber Security ([Download](.gitbook/assets/THM-DQEZT3RN3F\_intro\_to\_cyber\_security.png))
* Jr Penetration Tester ([Download](.gitbook/assets/THM-XIYCMOPEZM\_jr\_penetration\_tester.png))
* Web Fundamentals ([Download](.gitbook/assets/THM-RS0VG2QVZV\_web\_fundamentals\_learning\_path.png))
* Complete Beginner ([Download](.gitbook/assets/THM-99SBNZQHZC.png))

So i decided to switch the platform to Hack The Box and start the "Penetration Tester" path.

I also did some courses from The Cyber Mentor like the following:

* Practical Bug Bounty ([Download](.gitbook/assets/certificate-of-completion-for-practical-bug-bounty.pdf))
* Practical API Hacking ([Download](.gitbook/assets/certificate-of-completion-for-practical-api-hacking.pdf))
* Beginner's Guide to IoT and Hardware Hacking ([Download](.gitbook/assets/certificate-of-completion-for-beginner-s-guide-to-iot-and-hardware-hacking.pdf))
* Practical Ethical Hacking (Coming soon)
* Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners (Coming soon)
* Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners (Coming soon)

I had my first "1st Annual TCM Invitational CTF" from MetaCTF ([https://metactf.com/](https://metactf.com/)) with 3 international team mates and we gained place #38 of 166 teams :clap:

Yes there are just points from 3 of 4 people. One of us didn't get a single point because he just have startet with ethical hacking from about 3 months ago. That is not bad because he learned from us how to get some flags. As someone from us got a flag he described his path for us in the discord chat so the others can learn something.

I also got a certificate of completion of the "1st Annual TCM Invitational CTF" ([Download](.gitbook/assets/TCM\_MetaCTF\_Invitational\_CTF\_2023\_Certficate.pdf)).

In this book i will write down my paths through the boxes how i solved them. On the other hand i write some technical and non-technical reports from the solved boxes - as pentesters do.

### Procedure

You can get an insight of the [Terms of contract](report.md) which will always be the first part of a Penetration testing engagement. This content will just overkill the whole Pentester \~ Paths and Reports \~ Project. That's the reason why it will just stay there and counts for all Penetration tests and reports.

### Structure

You can look the structure of a Penetration test and report as following:

* Terms of contract
  * Disclaimer
  * Contract Information
  * Assessment Overview
  * Assessment Components
    * External Penetration Test
    * Internal Penetration Test
  * Finding Severity Ratings
  * Risk Factors
