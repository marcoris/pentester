## Disclaimer

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. Pentester Corp prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. Pentester Corp recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

## Assessment Overview

From March 11th, 2024 to March 15th, 2024 Demo Corp engaged Pentester Corp to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure compared to current industry best practices that included an internal network penetration test. All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks.

Phases of penetration testing activities include the following:

* Planning - Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
* Discovery - Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
* Attack - Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
* Reporting - Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.

## Assessment Components

### Internal Penetration Test

An internal penetration test emulates the role of an attacker from inside the network. An engineer will scan the network to identify potential host vulnerabilities and perform common and advanced internal network attacks, such as: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and other man- in-the-middle attacks, token impersonation, kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, golden ticket, and more. The engineer will seek to gain access to hosts through lateral movement, compromise domain user and admin accounts, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

### External Penetration Test

External penetration testing is a security assessment that simulates the tactics and techniques of real-world attackers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an organizationâ€™s external systems and networks. It is conducted by an external security team that encompasses a detailed source code review, and manual inspections.

Commonly, such external penetration testing is performed for web apps, mobile apps, network & network devices, and so on.

## Finding Severity Ratings

The following table defines levels of severity and corresponding CVSS score range that are used throughout the document to assess vulnerability and risk impact.

## Risk Factors

Risk is measured by two factors: Likelihood and Impact:

#### Likelihood <a href="#bookmark9" id="bookmark9"></a>

Likelihood measures the potential of a vulnerability being exploited. Ratings are given based on the difficulty of the attack, the available tools, attacker skill level, and client environment.

#### Impact <a href="#bookmark10" id="bookmark10"></a>

Impact measures the potential vulnerability's effect on operations, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client systems and/or data, reputational harm, and financial loss.
